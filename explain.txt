Approach for Processing Map Data with Metadata
1.Load and Parse JSON Data
   Read the location and metadata JSON files.
   Convert them into Python dictionaries/lists for easy processing.
2.Merge Data Based on id
  Create a dictionary from the locations JSON using id as the key (for quick lookups).
  Loop through the metadata and attach the matching location details.
3.Count Locations by Type
  Use a dictionary to count how many locations exist for each type (e.g., restaurants, hotels, cafes).
4.Calculate Average Ratings
  Maintain a sum of ratings and a count of locations for each type.
  Compute the average by dividing the total sum by the count.
5.Find the Location with the Most Reviews
  Iterate through the merged data and track the location with the highest number of reviews.
6.Check for Incomplete Data (Bonus)
  Identify entries where latitude or longitude is missing and flag them as incomplete.
